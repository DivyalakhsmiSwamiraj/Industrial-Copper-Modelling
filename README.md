### **INDUSTRIAL-COPPER-MODELLING**

## INTRODUCTION:
The Industrial Copper Modeling project focuses on predicting the selling price and status (won or lost) in the industrial copper market using machine learning regression and classification algorithms. By exploring the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and applying various machine learning techniques, we aim to develop models that can accurately predict the selling price and status in the copper market.

## INSTALLATION
To run this project, you need to install the following packages:
`````
pip install pandas
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
pip install openpyxl
pip install streamlit
``````
## METHODOLOGY:
1. Data Loading: Load the industrial copper dataset into the code using pandas library. Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove outliers if necessary, and perform necessary data transformations such as encoding categorical variables. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to explore the dataset. Analyze different variables, their distributions, and relationships. Generate visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, or box plots to gain insights into the data.

4. Machine Learning Regression: Apply various machine learning regression algorithms to predict the selling price of industrial copper. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, and evaluate their performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).

5. Machine Learning Classification: Apply different machine learning classification algorithms to predict the status (won or lost) of copper transactions. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
